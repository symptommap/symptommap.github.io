The Symptom Map Project.

The intention of this project is to use real time data to geographically map existing and emerging clusters of COVID 19 infections in real time using self reporting of temperature through smartphones.

The geographical mapping is intended to function to focus testing in a scenario where testing capacity is limited and to give relevant information about geographical spread to users. 

We intend to do this through a one page smartphone compatible web page that asks the user their current temperature and collects their gps location and date. Those without a thermometer can make a choice between ‘normal’ and ‘high’ estimated temperature. We can then provide a map by region to users of the website in graded colours to show the status of each area. This can update automatically. 

If we can collect a temperature DAILY from a large number of people we can map clusters by identifying geographic areas that have a larger volume of people with a high temperature. If health service stakeholders then (using targeted testing) identified cases in these clustered areas - they could ask all people with a temperature in that area - and their families sharing living space with them - to fully isolate immediately. This makes a smaller number of tests more effective in terms of containment. 

Substantial take up will make up for any quirks and issues with the data. People just need to make their best effort. It does not need to be perfect to work effectively. 

This approach will allow stakeholders to focus the testing process more accurately and economically.  People are locked down at present so there will be defined clusters. Health services can do focused mobile testing in areas where we see confirmed and emergent clusters and have it done faster. This can help stop propagation of clusters and help identify asymptomatic carriers. 

Similar projects are already up and running in the US and UK.
